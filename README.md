# HTML and CSS Clone - Youtube Video Player

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

The project is a dark-mode clone of the [Youtube video player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdou416rWvA) using HTML and CSS. The CSS is written using BEM with PascalCasing, as recommended in the [Airbnb CSS style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css). The website uses CSS grid, flexbox, iframes and media queries to recreate the responsive video player.
